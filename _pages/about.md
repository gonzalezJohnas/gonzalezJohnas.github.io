### More about me
I am a franco colombian men of 27th years old, passioante to recreate the human intelligence with robots or computers I complete complementary academic degrees that gives me knowedge in diverse tecnicals areas. 

### Computer science ###
I complete a Bachelor in computer science and signal analysis where I learn the fundamentals of computers and how to develop softwares following good practices such as desing patterns and management tecnique as AGILE. 

### Machine learning, Data Science ###
I followed my academic path with a Master degree in artificial intelligence where I learned different skills to develop intelligent software and how to integrate and scale them to real problems. 


#### Research Interests
I am passioned by machine learning and how we could build general intelligent system. I am doing research in developmental robotics where I tried to develop computational framework integrating bio-inspired processes along with machine learning. My goal is to design architectures for the iCub robot to perform self-supervised learning in task as objects, face detection or sound localisation.
