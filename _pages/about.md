### More about me
I am a franco Colombian men of 27th years old, passionate to recreate human intelligence with robots or computers I complete complementary academic degrees that give me knowledge in diverse technical areas. 

### Computer science ###
I complete a Bachelor in computer science and signal analysis where I learned the fundamentals of computers and how to develop software following good practices such as design patterns and management techniques as AGILE. 

### Machine learning, Data Science ###
I followed my academic path with a Master's degree in artificial intelligence where I learned different skills to develop intelligent software and how to integrate and scale them to real problems. 


#### Research Interests
I am passionate by machine learning and how we could build general intelligent systems. I am doing research in developmental robotics where I tried to develop computational frameworks integrating bio-inspired processes along with machine learning. My goal is to design architectures for the iCub robot to perform self-supervised learning in tasks as objects, face detection or sound localisation.
