*August 2015 - October 2015*<br>
I developed a prototype to recreate a virtual bookshelf from a bookshelf image taken with a smartphone.  I worked on a computer vision pipeline to extract the different tranches of the books to extract their location in the image. The extracted tranches where then analysed with an optical character recogntion algorithm to identify them though the Google books API.  

#### Programming language
Java, C++

#### Library used
