### Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Since infancy, humans can learn from social context to associate words with their meanings, for example associating names with objects. 
The open-question is which computational framework could replicate the abilities of toddlers in developing language and its meaning in robots. We propose a computational framework in this paper to be implemented on a robotics platform to replicate the early learning process of humans for the specific task of word-object mapping.
