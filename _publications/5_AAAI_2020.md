### Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
In  the  future  robots  will  interact  more  and  more with humans and will have to communicate in a natural and efficient way. Automatic speech recognition systems (ASR) will play an  important  role  in  creating  natural  interactions  and  making robots  better  companions.  Humans  excel  in  speech  recognition in  noisy  environments  and  are  able  to  filter  out  noise.  Looking to  a  personâ€™s  face  is  one  of  the  mechanisms  that  humans  rely on when it comes to filtering speech in such noisy environments.Having a robot that is able to look toward a speaker could benefitASR  performance  in  challenging  environments.  We  propose  a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework inspired by the early development of humans to allow the robot to autonomously learn  to  localize  speakers.
