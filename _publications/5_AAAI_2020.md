### Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
In  the  future  robots  will  interact  more  and  morewith humans and will have to communicate in a natural and ef-ficient way. Automatic speech recognition systems (ASR) will playan  important  role  in  creating  natural  interactions  and  makingrobots  better  companions.  Humans  excel  in  speech  recognitionin  noisy  environments  and  are  able  to  filter  out  noise.  Lookingto  a  personâ€™s  face  is  one  of  the  mechanisms  that  humans  relyon when it comes to filtering speech in such noisy environments.Having a robot that is able to look toward a speaker could benefitASR  performance  in  challenging  environments.  We  propose  aself-supervised reinforcement learning framework inspired by theearly development of humans to allow the robot to autonomouslylearn  to  localize  speakers.
